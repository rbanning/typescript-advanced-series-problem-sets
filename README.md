# Typescript Advanced Series
## Problem Sets

### Overview
The **Typescript Advanced Series** offers a problem-based approach toward expanding your Typescript knowledge.  
Through a series of *problems*, learners are exposed to an array of Typescript concepts as well as analytical
challenges.  We talk about **union types** as well as **bubble sorts**, **generic conditional types** as well as 
**decision graphs**.

The **Series** is designed for learners who have some experience with Typescript and are looking to expand their
understanding of TS concepts and discover new TS features.  The **Series** also provides a challenge to experienced
TS coders.  Some of the problems may be easy while other may require more effort, but hopefully, you will 
discover new approaches that you can apply to your everyday coding.

### Repository
This repository is the set of **problems** and **solutions** presented in the **Series**.
